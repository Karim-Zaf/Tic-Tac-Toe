# TIC TAC TOE GAME

I've built a web application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS that allows players to enjoy a classic game of Tic Tac Toe. In this 1v1 game, one player uses X while the other uses O, with X starting first. The objective is to be the first to create a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the 3x3 grid. The game provides a fun and interactive experience, with responsive design ensuring a funny gameplay across different devices.
